Hello, my name's ems and I use she/her pronouns.

INTJ (8w1) law. Neu


I'm not a very social person, I'm very much happy with my alone time and I've spent enough energy on real life. I'm not person who seeks alot of friends, I only have 𝐨𝐧𝐞 close friend, I could only tolerate 3 friends that also include my close friend cuz I would be overwhelmed if I had to socialize all the time.

I don't mind talking to ppl, but I can comes off as dry or an ignorant when in reality I js don't know what to say and js awkward. 

You'd have to deal with my avoidant attachment, fatigue and isolation in order to be my friend. And hell, if I were to be confortable, you'd need to be extremely patient cuz I would be yapping anything to u, whether it is my interests or random shyt. I get annoyed easily when i'm in a bad mood or in a fatigue stage cuz then I would want ALOT of personal space.
